# Final Project: Graphs 

## Overview
This project involves the implementation of a graph data structure in C++. It supports basic graph operations such as adding nodes and edges, 
cycle detection, and performing depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

## Note
Material is from COSC:2436, taught by Dr. Katrompas. Itâ€™s intended for fellow classmates and for my own review and improvement.

## Features
- **Graph Operations**: Add nodes, add edges, retrieve nodes, and retrieve all nodes.
- **Cycle Detection**: Check if the graph contains any cycles.
- **Graph Traversals**: Perform DFS and BFS to traverse the graph.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: Handle self-loops, isolated nodes, and non-existent nodes.
- **Performance Testing**: Test the graph implementation with large datasets to ensure scalability.

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main function for testing the graph class. It includes various tests to validate the functionality of the graph operations.
- `graph.h`: Header file defining the `Node` and `Graph` classes.
- `graph.cpp`: Implementation file for the `Node` and `Graph` classes.
- `function.cpp`: Additional helper functions used by the graph class.
